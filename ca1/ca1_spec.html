<h1 class="title">CA1 specification</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> 20%</p>
<p><strong>Deadline:</strong> 27/01/2025 21:00</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>You are to host a service of your choice on the Azure platform using
primarily IaaS components (e.g. VM, VNet).</p>
<p>It is recommended, but not mandatory, that you use a Java JSP/Servlet
application backed by a database. Whether you use a Windows, Linux (or
other OS) VM is entirely up to you.</p>
<h1 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h1>
<h2 id="description-10">Description (10%)</h2>
<p>Provide in a text file named <code>description.txt</code> a brief
description of the service(s) you are planning to host.</p>
<h2 id="infrastructure-setup-file-20">Infrastructure setup file
(20%)</h2>
<p>Provide a setup file that will create your environment named
<code>setup.ps1</code>.</p>
<p>It should create your main resources in a resource group named
<code>ca1_rg</code>.</p>
<p>Your setup file should be <em>idempotent</em> such that it will
either:</p>
<ul>
<li>detect / ignore / repair partially built environments</li>
<li>refuse to continue to run if the <code>ca1_rg</code> group is
present</li>
</ul>
<p>Although it’s not mandatory you <em>can</em> use Azure resource
manager templates to build your environment as long as they are
instantiated from the setup file. (If you do, obviously make sure that
you include them in your submission!)</p>
<h2 id="cloud-init-file-20">Cloud init file (20%)</h2>
<p>Provide a cloud init file named <code>vm_init.yml</code> for your VM.
You should aim to set up as much as possible in this file to minimise
work in subsequent steps.</p>
<h2 id="vm-setup-20">VM setup (20%)</h2>
<p>In a file <code>instructions.txt</code> provide a basic set of
instructions for someone of the same skill level as you to work through
the VM setup steps required, particularly any manual steps needed. You
can (and should) include any script(s) in your repository.</p>
<h2 id="teardown-file-10">Teardown file (10%)</h2>
<p>Provide a teardown file named <code>teardown.ps1</code> that will
remove your environment. It is normally sufficient to delete the
resource group involved.</p>
<h2 id="use-of-version-control-10">Use of version control (10%)</h2>
<p>Marks in this section will be awarded for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reasonable commit history, suggest at least 10 or more.</li>
<li>Meaningful commit messages.</li>
<li>Files not required ignored using <code>.gitignore</code> and not
present in the repository.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="checking-for-required-files">Checking for required files</h1>
<p>A number of the steps above require you to submit specific files with
specific names.</p>
<p>Depending on how you carried out some steps, you may have additional
files required (e.g. a setup script calls another script or template).
Make sure that no file paths are absolute
(e.g. <code>C:\Users\grantp\template.json</code>), and that all are
relative.</p>
<h1 id="submission">Submission</h1>
<p>Your work should be presented in a Git repository named exactly
<code>cloud_arch_ca1</code> (case sensitive) on the <a
href="https://gitlab.comp.dkit.ie/">school’s GitLab server</a>. No
submissions will be taken by e-mail, Moodle or other means.</p>
<p>To be accepted for grading, you must:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Name your repository exactly <code>cloud_arch_ca1</code>.</li>
<li>Add <code>grantp</code> with <em>Developer</em> access to your
repository.</li>
</ol>
<p>Repositories that are incorrectly named or that I cannot access will
be treated as a non-submission and will receive a zero grade. This will
be strictly enforced.</p>
<p>You are therefore encouraged to set up your repository and give me
access as soon as you start the CA. There’s no point leaving it until
the last minute. Once you have the repository set up and have added me
you should as for it to be checked that I can see it.</p>
<p>The most recent commit in advance of the deadline will be graded.</p>
<h1 id="demonstration">Demonstration</h1>
<p>You will be required to demonstrate your solution briefly during a
lab session. The demonstration should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup automatically including the creation of all resources.</li>
<li>VM setup via cloud-init and perhaps afterwards (e.g. file
transfer)</li>
<li>System running</li>
<li>Teardown</li>
</ul>
<p>It is expected that you will be able to explain in professional terms
how you achieved the system’s functionality.</p>
<h1 id="feedback">Feedback</h1>
<p>Group feedback will be provided in class.</p>
<p>Individual summary feedback will be provided on Moodle. More detailed
verbal feedback is available on request.</p>
